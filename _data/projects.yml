  about: >
    Nulu uses fresh news content for articles to provide an engaging way for
    students to learn foreign language. Content is produced by Nulu and provides
    high quality translations (with phrase mapping), and voice overs that read
    the story/article along with you. Along with the articles, users can also
    test their knowledge with quizzes and a review system that displays phrases
    in a game (cloze test) format. Higher level user plans give access to
    tutors that interact with their students through a voice and text
    asynchronous messaging system that is built into the web application
    using HTML 5 media elements.

  about: >
    This yet to be named photo application was developed as a way to share and
    back up my photos. My friends and family will be set up with user accounts,
    and if financially viable, I'd also like to open it up to other users. The
    target user is a hobbyist photographer using dslr or other similar level
    cameras.
